# nsset-exponentials
Joint work with prof. John Rognes (University of Oslo). In nsset-htythy I establish non-singular simplicial sets as a cofibrantly generated model category, which is Quillen equivalent to simplicial sets with the standard structure due to Quillen. In order to do that, I need the result of nsset-exponentials.
